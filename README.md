# TreasureHuntFinal-master



Mobile App Treasure Hunt
A campus-wide android game deployed as a way to obtain accurate sensors data from multiple devices. 
Users can get coins by sharing data from anywhere in the campus using the sensors available in their phones.
Two types of sensors are considered. Environment-related sensors such as a thermometer and motion-based ones such as an accelerometer. 
The coins earned by the user are spent with the aim of finding the treasure hidden in the campus field (i.e., buried underground). The campus field is represented by a map divided into squares (cells) based on a reasonable scale (i.e., 1meter * 1 meter). Each cell has multiple underground layers varying from 10 to 20.
